/*
 & = Bitwise And  Its behave like  &&

 ~ = -(n+1)    
 ^ =Bitwise EXO   if both bits are diffrent then retern one[1] BUt its calculate bit like || oprator
 << shift last two digit to front and remainig take as a zero
 EX . 1010   -->  1000

 <<  =  x << n = x * 2^n
 >>  =  x >> n = x/2^n
